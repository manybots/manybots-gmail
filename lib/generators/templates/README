A note about Gmail OAuth configuration options

You can edit 'config/initializers/manybots_gmail.rb' to use your app id and 
secret. 

They're set to 'anonymous' by default, which should be fine.

Now what?

- Run `bundle exec rake db:migrate` to get your db up to speed
- Go to '/manybots_gmail' and start collecting your emails (you might have to relaunch the server)

You can find help on the Manybots Dev mailing list.
